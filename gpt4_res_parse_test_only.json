It is clear that previous limitations are being overcome by the new method, indicating a significant influence.\n\n- **b10**: Similar to b13, this reference is cited concerning seed-guided topic discovery methods and the challenges addressed by SEETOPIC.\n\n- **b24**: This reference is connected to embedding learning in the SEETOPIC framework, indicating a methodological influence.\n\n- **b26**: Mentioned in the context of topic coherence and the PMI, which are part of the optimization objectives in SEETOPIC. Given its role in evaluating the model, it has a strong relevance.\n\n- **b30** & **b37**: Both are related to the use of pre-trained tokenizers in PLMs, which are a part of the general representation in SEETOPIC, showing direct relevance to the methods used.\n\nThese references are given higher confidence scores because they are directly related to the novel contributions and methodologies of the SEETOPIC model. Other references, even if mentioned, are not given scores because they either did not meet the criteria of strong methodological influence or were mentioned in a context that does not strongly suggest they were a source of inspiration for the main contributions of the SEETOPIC paper."], "621ee1895aee126c0f26af67": ["```json\n{\n  \"b51\": 0.8,\n  \"b11\": 0.8,\n  \"b67\": 0.8,\n  \"b5\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b14\": 0.8,\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9,\n    \"b19\": 0.8,\n    \"b20\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b51\": 0.9,\n  \"b11\": 0.9,\n  \"b67\": 0.9,\n  \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b14\": 0.8,\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9,\n    \"b20\": 0.85\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b51\": 1.0,\n  \"b11\": 0.9,\n  \"b67\": 0.9,\n  \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b51\": 0.9,\n    \"b11\": 0.9,\n    \"b67\": 0.9,\n    \"b5\": 0.9\n}\n```"], "628749425aee126c0ffee615": ["```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 0.9,\n  \"b26\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 0.95,\n  \"b26\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b12\": 0.9,\n    \"b26\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 0.9,\n  \"b26\": 0.9,\n  \"b39\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 0.9,\n  \"b26\": 0.8,\n  \"b39\": 0.7\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b12\": 0.9,\n    \"b26\": 0.85\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b12\": 0.9,\n    \"b26\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 1.0,\n  \"b26\": 0.9,\n  \"b39\": 0.8\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n    \"b12\": 0.9,\n    \"b26\": 0.9\n}\n```", "```json\n{\n  \"b12\": 0.9,\n  \"b26\": 0.8,\n  \"b29\": 0.7\n}\n```"], "62451c2b5aee126c0f47ab40": ["Based on the text, the primary challenges outlined in the paper are improving the performance of pretrained language models and incorporating multi-hop knowledge into language model pretraining.

If there are more references in the full text that are relevant to the novel contributions, they should be included in the analysis as well.", "Based on the text provided, we need to identify the source papers that have the strongest influence on the novel contributions of the paper discussing \"Atlas,\" a retrieval-augmented language model. To do this, we should focus on the phrases that indicate a strong reliance on previous research and the references cited in close proximity to these phrases.\n\nHere are the steps we will take to identify the source papers:\n\n1. Identify novel contributions of the paper:\n   - Design and training of retrieval-augmented language models for few-shot learning.\n   - The development of Atlas, a retrieval-augmented language model with strong few-shot capabilities at a lower scale.\n   - Exploration of fine-tuning strategies for the retriever and language model.\n   - Downstream experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art results.\n\n2. Locate phrases indicating strong reliance on previous research:\n   - The paper explicitly mentions using a \"retrieval-augmented architecture\" and a \"general-purpose dense retriever using a dual-encoder architecture, based on the Contriever.\"\n   - It references the \"Fusion-in-Decoder architecture\" for the sequence-to-sequence model.\n   - Training objectives mention \"attention distillation\" inspired by a previous paper and \"EMDR2,\" which is another method introduced by a different paper.\n\n3. Extract references with direct relevance to the novel contributions:\n   - Contriever [b29] is mentioned as the basis for the retriever module.\n   - Fusion-in-Decoder [b27] is mentioned as the architecture used for the language model processing.\n   - The text-to-text framework is mentioned, and reference [b59] is cited in this context.\n   - Attention Distillation is inspired by previous work, with reference [b86].\n   - EMDR2 method was introduced by reference [b64].\n\n4. Prioritize references based on methodological similarity and direct inspiration phrases:\n   - The paper's core contribution lies in the retrieval-augmented language model for few-shot learning, so references [b29] and [b27] are highly relevant.\n   - The methodological approach is similar to those described in [b86] and [b64].\n\n5. Create a JSON object with the identified references and confidence scores:\n```json\n{\n  \"b29\": 1.0,\n  \"b27\": 1.0,\n  \"b59\": 0.9,\n  \"b86\": 0.8,\n  \"b64\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores reflect the degree to which the paper relies on the methodological foundation provided by each reference. References [b29] and [b27] have the highest confidence scores because they are directly used in building the core components of Atlas. Reference [b59] is also given a high confidence score because it influences the overall framework approach.

Identify the novel contributions of the paper:\n   - A systematic study of three parameter-efficient tuning methods: Adapter, LoRA, and VPT.\n   - The proposal of a new concept called neural prompt search (NOAH) to automatically search for the optimal prompt design from data via a neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm.\n   - An efficient NAS-based implementation of NOAH.\n   - Evidence that NOAH outperforms individual prompt modules in transfer learning, few-shot learning, and domain generalization.\n\n2. Locate key phrases indicating direct inspiration:\n   - \"Our approach is motivated by the observation that none of the three individuals shows dominance on the VTAB-1k benchmark.\"\n   - \"We employ a one-shot NAS algorithm, AutoFormer [b4], for prompt module search.\"\n\n3. Determine the source papers:\n   - The key idea of parameter-efficient tuning methods: Adapter [b17], LoRA [b18], and VPT [b19].\n   - The one-shot NAS algorithm, AutoFormer [b4], used for the prompt module search.\n   - The use of ViT as the base model for NOAH, which is referenced [b9].\n\n4. Re-evaluate and prioritize methodological similarity:\n   - AutoFormer [b4] shares methodological similarities, as it is directly used in the paper for the NAS component of NOAH.\n   - Adapter [b17], LoRA [b18], and VPT [b19] are not just reviewed but are also incorporated into the search space of NOAH, suggesting direct methodological relevance.\n   - Vision Transformer (ViT) [b9] is the architecture to which NOAH is mainly applied, indicating a strong methodological link.\n\n5.

The paper introduces \"Shotgun,\" a BTB-directed front-end prefetcher powered by a new BTB organization specialized for effective prefetching.\n\n2.

The scores reflect the perceived relevance and direct influence on the paper's contributions.", "```json\n{\n  \"b29\": 0.8,\n  \"b34\": 0.9,\n  \"b36\": 0.9,\n  \"b17\": 0.7,\n  \"b4\": 0.6,\n  \"b5\": 0.6,\n  \"b21\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of Confidence Scores:\n- **b34** and **b36**: High confidence (0.9), as these references are directly related to the challenges and novel approaches (domain-specific tags, walker logic, cache structure) discussed extensively in the paper.\n- **b29**: High confidence (0.8) because it is mentioned alongside b34 and b36, implying significant relevance, but slightly less since it is not as central to the X-Cache discussion as b34 and b36.\n- **b17**: Moderate confidence (0.7) due to its mention in the context of DSAs and hash tables, which are pertinent to the paper's contributions, but with less emphasis compared to b34 and b36.\n- **b4** and **b5**: Moderate confidence (0.6) as these are mentioned in the context of prior work on walkers and cache-like structures, which are relevant to the paper's contributions but are not the main focus.\n- **b21**: Moderate confidence (0.7) since it is listed with other DSAs that X-Cache was applied to, showing its relevance to the paper's contributions, but the context does not indicate it as central as b34 and b36.\n\nThese references are prioritized based on their strong methodological similarities to the paper analyzed and the phrases indicating direct inspiration or motivation, as well as the novel contributions of the paper.", "Based on the provided text, the paper introduces an architectural template for domain-specific caches, which is named X-Cache. The novelty of their approach includes:\n\n1. DSA-specific tags (Meta-tags): Allowing metadata fields to serve as cache tags.\n2. DSA-programmable walking (X-Routine): Enabling custom walkers for different DSAs specified by microcode actions.\n3. DSA-agnostic controller architecture: Implementing walkers and data orchestration as coroutines for better efficiency and parallelism.\n\nNow, to identify the source papers that inspired these novel contributions, we look for key phrases that signal direct dependence on prior work:\n\n1. \"Inspired by\", \"motivated by\", \"following... we adopt... to solve\", \"we use... based on to achieve...\"\n2. Direct references linked to the main challenges and methods.\n3. Phrases indicating a strong reliance on previous research.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, the following references seem to be directly relevant to the paper's novel contributions:\n\n- **[b29] and [b34]**: Mentioned in conjunction with the use of meta-tags and the design of DSAs.\n- **[b36]**: Cited in relation to sparse data structures and also mentioned with meta-tags and walkers.\n- **[b4]** and **[b5]**: Associated with the discussion on walkers and coroutines versus traditional blocking threads.\n- **[b17]**: Referenced in the context of dynamic accesses and hash tables, which may relate to the paper's focus on DSAs for dynamic and irregular access patterns.\n\nThe confidence score is subjective and would typically be assigned based on the extent to which these papers seem to have influenced the novel contributions of the current work.

This suggests that [b13] is a key source paper for the current work.\n  \n- **b10** (0.85): Reference [b10] is mentioned in the context of similar masking approaches for optimizing the number of channels in a 2D convolutional layer, and the current work's novel contribution is extending this to filter size and dilation. This indicates a strong methodological similarity and direct inspiration.\n  \n- **b9** (0.85): Similar to [b10], reference [b9] is also mentioned in relation to masking approaches for optimizing network architecture, specifically in the context of fine-grain NAS, which relates closely to the novel contributions of the paper.\n  \n- **b12** (0.75): ProxylessNAS, mentioned in [b12], is discussed as an advanced DNAS tool that inspired the current work. However, the authors of the current paper seem to build upon and potentially improve this method, so it's not as central as the above references.\n  \n- **b6** (0.7): Reference [b6] is cited in relation to the introduction of TCNs and their advantages over RNNs, which forms a foundational aspect of the current work's focus on TCNs. This suggests that [b6] has a significant influence on the current paper.\n  \n- **b26** (0.65): In discussing DNAS tools, [b26] is referenced as the introduction of supernets, which is relevant to the paper's methodology. Although influential, it seems to be less central than [b10] and [b9] in terms of direct methodological contributions.\n  \n- **b27** (0.6): Reference [b27] is noted in the context of Single-Path NAS, which is related to the methodological approach of the current work. However, the paper seems to focus more on the concepts from [b9] and [b10], so [b27] is given slightly less weight.\n  \n- **b30** (0.6): The term \"structured pruning\" appears in the text, and [b30] is cited in relation to this concept. Since structured pruning is a core mechanism in the proposed NAS tool, this paper is likely influential, but there isn't enough context to rate its influence as highly as [b13], [b10], or [b9]. \n\nThese confidence scores reflect the perceived influence and relevance of each cited work to the novel contributions of the current paper, based on the provided text and instructions.", "```json\n{\n  \"b13\": 0.9,\n  \"b10\": 0.8,\n  \"b9\": 0.7,\n  \"b12\": 0.6,\n  \"b6\": 0.5,\n  \"b8\": 0.4,\n  \"b11\": 0.3,\n  \"b26\": 0.2\n}\n```\n\nExplanation for confidence scores:\n\n- **b13**: High confidence (0.9) because the authors mention their own previous work which proposed the first lightweight NAS specifically designed for optimizing TCNs.\n- **b10**: High confidence (0.8) as the authors reference similar masking approaches for optimizing the number of channels in 2D convolutional layers, which their work extends to filter size and dilation.\n- **b9**: Moderate to high confidence (0.7) because they discuss DMaskingNAS approaches which are related to their methodology, although focusing on 2D CNNs.\n- **b12**: Moderate confidence (0.6) as the authors mention ProxylessNAS as an advanced DNAS that is related to their work for its memory-efficient search strategy.\n- **b6**: Moderate confidence (0.5) for citing the computational advantages of TCNs which is central to the research context of the paper.\n- **b8**: Lower confidence (0.4) since it is mentioned as part of the background on NAS approaches, but it's not clear how directly it influenced the novel contributions.\n- **b11**: Lower confidence (0.3) for similar reasons as b8, being part of the NAS methodology background.\n- **b26**: Low confidence (0.2) due to being part of the broader discussion on DNAS with supernets, but not stated as a direct influence on the novel approach.\n\nThe selected references are based on the authors' statements that connect their contributions to previous works (e.g., \"In Risso et al.

The mention of QASPER represents a direct comparative analysis, signaling that it is a primary source of inspiration or motivation for the current work.\n\n- **b23, b24, b31 (Datasets for QA on Academic Papers)**: These references are given a moderate confidence score because they discuss existing datasets in the same domain that the authors' QASA benchmark is part of. Although they are mentioned as part of the related work, they do not seem to be the main inspiration for the novel contributions of the current paper.\n\n- **b2 (LongFormer)**: This reference has a high confidence score due to its methodological relevance. The authors mention an alternative approach (using LongFormer) to handle long documents, which is directly related to the task the authors are addressing. The mention suggests that LongFormer could be a foundation or a point of comparison for their work.\n\n- **b42 (Prior work on discourse structure)**: This reference gets a moderate to high confidence score because it relates to the evidential rationale-generation step of the authors' proposed method.

contributes.\n\n- References b28 and b21 (0.6) are related to ontological knowledge models but are less directly connected to the paper's contribution.\n\n- References b11 and b40 (0.5) are included due to their connection with NLP tasks and ontological knowledge but are not as central to the paper's novel contributions.\n\n- Reference b1 (0.9) is given the highest confidence score due to the paper's use of DBpedia for ontology building, which is a novel contribution.\n\n- Reference b38 (0.8) relates to the use of Wikidata, which is also part of the methodology for ontology construction.\n\n- References b4 and b9 (0.7) relate to RDF and RDFS, which are foundational to the reasoning tasks constructed in the paper.\n\n- Reference b37 (0.7) is given this confidence score due to the specific mention of refining the experimental setup used by this work.\n\n- References b6 and b26 (0.9) are highly relevant as they are the PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) that the paper probes,

(PLMs) being probed in the paper for their ontological knowledge. The paper is investigating the ability of these PLMs to memorize and reason with ontological knowledge, which directly involves these language models.\n- Reference **b7** (OpenPrompt) is given a high confidence score since it is the key tool used for prompt learning in the probing task.\n- References **b17**, **b31**, and **b33** are highly relevant as they discuss existing probing works on factual knowledge, which is an important foundation for the paper\u2019s investigation into ontological knowledge.\n- References **b3**, **b29**, and **b23** are somewhat relevant because they discuss classes and concepts, which are part of ontological knowledge, but they are not the main focus of the paper.\n- Reference **b11** and **b40** discuss the application of ontological knowledge in NLP tasks, which is related to the paper\u2019s goal of probing PLMs for ontological knowledge encoding.\n- Reference **b1** is related to the construction of the ontology using DBpedia, which is a significant part of the methodology in the paper.\n- Reference **b38** is related to the collection of properties based on DBpedia and Wikidata, relevant to the methodology.\n- References **b4** and **b9** are related to RDF and RDFS, which are standards for encoding knowledge on the web and are relevant to the reasoning tasks constructed in the paper.\n- Reference **b37** is somewhat relevant as it is mentioned in the context of experimental setup for reasoning tasks.\n- References **b34**, **b25**, and **b22** discuss manual prompts, soft prompts, and prompt perturbation, which are related to the probing methods but not as central as the primary PLMs and probing tools.", "```json\n{\n  \"b0\": 0.6,\n  \"b11\": 0.8,\n  \"b17\": 0.7,\n  \"b21\": 0.5,\n  \"b28\": 0.5,\n  \"b31\": 0.7,\n  \"b33\": 0.7,\n  \"b3\": 0.6,\n  \"b29\": 0.6,\n  \"b23\": 0.6,\n  \"b40\": 0.8,\n  \"b1\": 1.0,\n  \"b38\": 1.0,\n  \"b4\": 0.9,\n  \"b9\": 0.9,\n  \"b37\": 0.7,\n  \"b6\": 1.0,\n  \"b26\": 1.0,\n  \"b7\": 0.9,\n  \"b34\": 0.7,\n  \"b25\": 0.8,\n  \"b22\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nIn the provided text, references [b1] (DBpedia), [b38] (Wikidata), [b4] and [b9] (RDFS and RDF) are crucial as they are the foundational sources for ontology building, entailment rules, and data models, which are core to the paper's contributions. References [b6] (BERT) and [b26] (RoBERTa) are directly relevant because the probing methods involve these specific PLMs. [b7] (OpenPrompt) is also central due to its use in the experiment's prompt methods.\n\nOther references like [b11], [b40], [b0], [b17], [b31], [b33], [b3], [b29], [b23], [b21], and [b28] are relatively less central but are related to the background or previous works in probing PLMs, ontological knowledge, and classes.\n\nThe confidence scores reflect the direct relevance of each reference to the paper's novel contributions. The highest confidence is given to those references which form the backbone of the paper\u2019s methodology and experimental setup. Other references with lower confidence scores are still related to the paper's topic but are not as critical to its novel contributions.

Instead, the paper's novel contributions are the Multi-scale Stochastic Distribution Prediction (MSDP) and the use of a multi-scale stochastic sampling method.\n\n- Reference [b7] is highlighted as the most similar literature under the methodology of NBP, proposing to predict the long-term user behavior over a certain period of time. This is closely related to the paper's novel contribution of predicting user behavior over multiple periods, hence the higher confidence score.\n\n- Reference [b6] is similar to the proposed work but employs a different methodology, learning the sequence representation by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between item occurrence distributions. Given that the paper's contribution is about predicting behavior distribution, this reference is quite relevant, hence the higher confidence score.\n\n- References [b3], [b1], and [b15] discuss contrastive learning and Siamese networks for learning user-oriented representations. Since the paper introduces a Contrastive Regularization term and is concerned with user behavioral sequences, these references are relevant, though slightly less central to the novel contribution than [b7] and [b6].\n\n- Reference [b8] is mentioned in the context of multi-task prompt training, which the paper adopts for its model training approach. Since this approach is a key part of the methodology, the reference is given a high confidence score.\n\nThe confidence scores reflect the degree to which the mentioned references are central to the paper's novel contributions based on the given criteria. References are limited to the ones that are methodologically similar or serve as a basis for the paper's key innovations, excluding broad historical or methodological references.", "```json\n{\n  \"b7\": 0.8,\n  \"b6\": 0.75,\n  \"b3\": 0.7,\n  \"b8\": 0.65\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paper outlines a novel approach for user modeling from unlabeled data by introducing the Multi-scale Stochastic Distribution Prediction (MSDP). The key phrases indicating direct inspiration or methodological underpinning are:\n\n- The authors mention that most literature in behavioral sequence representation learning follows conventional NLP methodologies for setting pre-training tasks, mentioning references [b4], [b12], [b9], [b14], [b17], and [b13]. However, these are mentioned more as a historical context or as methods that the current paper is pivoting away from, rather than as inspirations for the current methodology.\n\n- The paper identifies [b7] as the most similar literature under the methodology of Next Behavior Prediction (NBP), which suggests that it is a direct precursor to the paper's proposed method. The paper draws inspiration from [b7] to predict long-term user behavior over a period of time, although [b7] is not exactly the same methodology.\n\n- Reference [b6] is highlighted as being similar but not following conventional methodologies. It employs a hypothesis of distribution consistency, which seems to align with the paper\u2019s MSDP concept, even though the implementation differs.\n\n- For the Multi-task Prompt Training section, the paper mentions being inspired by works like [b8], which employs a prompt training approach. The paper adopts a similar approach but specifically tailors it for user behavior prediction over different time scales.\n\n- The paper introduces a Contrastive Regularization term inspired by contrastive learning methodologies, citing [b3] as a relevant work using contrastive learning for modeling sequence-level user representation.\n\nGiven the outlined approach and the references, it seems that [b7], [b6], [b3], and [b8] are the most pertinent sources that have directly influenced the paper's novel contributions.
