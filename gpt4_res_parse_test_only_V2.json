The authors discuss the problem of misinformation and disinformation in online ecosystems, highlighting the importance of automated fact-checking systems. They particularly mention the benchmarks FEVER, SCIFACT, and COVIDFACT ([b39], [b42], [b36]) which are used to design systems that validate claims against evidence documents.\n\n2. The paper introduces novel adversarial settings: ADVERSARIAL ADDITION (ADVADD) and ADVERSARIAL MODIFICATION (ADVMOD). This suggests they are looking into the contamination of evidence sets used by fact-checking systems with synthetic disinformation.\n\n3. There is a mention of the use of neural language models capable of generating coherent disinformation ([b46], [b5]) which can bias the evidence bases used by automated fact-checkers.\n\n4. The paper evaluates the impact of synthetic disinformation on the performance of fact-checking systems, indicating a study on the generation and detection of synthetic disinformation ([b46], [b19]).\n\nBased on this information and the context in which these references appear, here is a JSON format list of source papers with confidence scores:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"b39\": 0.9,\n    \"b42\": 0.9,\n    \"b36\": 0.9,\n    \"b46\": 0.8,\n    \"b5\": 0.8,\n    \"b19\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are determined based on how central the references appear to be to the paper's novel contributions and the strength of the language that suggests inspiration or methodological similarity.

The paper proposes Ada-GNN, a model-agnostic framework for subgroup-level personalization on large-scale graphs. This is the main novel contribution.\n2. The Ada-GNN framework is \"inspired by the framework of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)\" [b2].\n3. The framework uses METIS [b7] for graph partitioning, but METIS is not a direct influence on the novel contribution; it's a tool used within the proposed framework.\n4. Ada-GNN takes inspiration from existing GNN models and aims to adapt to local patterns. Some of the GNN models discussed are SGC [b20], SIGN [b14], and SAGN [b16].

The use of attention blocks [b39] [b42] [b6] in the architecture suggests these are relevant sources, especially since they adapted these concepts for video data.\n\n6. The concept of classifier-free guidance [b12] is used for conditional generation, indicating this reference as directly relevant to their contributions.\n\n7.

The mention of \"motivated and implemented differently\" when referring to [b42] and [b49] suggests a strong influence but with a differentiation in approach.

For the SGAP abstraction, the text indicates that \"current researches only focus on specific GNN instances, rather than the general design space\" which suggests that their work differs from the specific instances previously studied. References to scalable GNN systems such as SGC [b51], SIGN [b11], S2GC [b67], and GBP [b5] are mentioned in the context of being special instances within the proposed design space. These references may have inspired the authors to create a more general design space.\n\n2. For the auto-search system, the authors discuss the limitations of previous works in neural architecture search [b10] [b40] [b64] and propose their solution, which is tailored for scalable GNNs under the SGAP. The references to Auto-GNN [b66] and GraphNAS [b12] suggest that these works may have inspired the methodology for the auto-search system, but the authors' work is distinguished by its focus on scalability and efficiency.\n\n3. The authors mention that they are motivated by the need for extensive exploration over the design space for scalable GNNs, which existing approaches like [b11] [b51] [b62] [b67] only focus on specific instances.

This indicates that the paper's contributions are a direct response to the limitations of these models.\n- The auto-search system in PaSca is said to be different from other works in neural architecture search, like [b66] and [b12]. This suggests that these works could have informed the design of the auto-search system, but the direct influence is less clear.\n- The paper mentions that it differs from previous work by addressing both training and model scalability challenges.

The PATHFID model for multi-hop question answering.\n2. The linearization of hierarchical reasoning paths for QA as a single sequence prediction task.\n3.

Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) model: The PATHFID model extends the FID model's capabilities for multi-hop QA. The FID model, based on pre-trained transformers like T5, is mentioned as achieving state-of-the-art scores for single-hop QA benchmarks. The FID model's limitations in multi-hop QA are addressed by PATHFID. (Reference [b14], [b31])\n\n2. Hierarchical Reasoning Path: The paper proposes modeling the full reasoning path hierarchically, which is an extension of existing work in multi-hop QA. This suggests that previous work on reasoning paths ([b0]) and hierarchical representations ([b2], [b42]) may be relevant.\n\n3. Comparison with Existing Models: The PATHFID model is compared with existing multi-hop QA models, highlighting its novel contributions. The comparison and the limitations of existing models ([b40]) provide context for the development of PATHFID.\n\nConsidering the instructions and the context in which the references are mentioned, the source papers that directly influenced the PATHFID model can be inferred.

Identify the novel contributions of the paper:\n   - The development of the PATHFID model, a generative QA model that explicitly models the full reasoning path for multi-hop QA.\n   - The extension of multi-hop QA beyond answer generation to include reasoning path generation.\n   - The introduction of hierarchical reasoning paths and global input representation with cross-passage interactions (PATHFID+).\n\n2. Look for references indicating direct inspiration, motivation, or methodological similarity:\n   - The mention of \"fusion-in-decoder (FID)\" indicates that the PATHFID model is built upon or inspired by the FID model, which is referenced as [b14].\n   - The discussion of the limitations of FID in multi-hop QA suggests that [b14] and [b40] are relevant as they relate to FID and its challenges.\n\n3.

Reference [b40] is also relevant as it corroborates the findings that FID does not extend well to multi-hop QA, which is a central challenge that PATHFID addresses. Other references mentioned in the context of the challenges of multi-hop QA and existing approaches (like [b3], [b22], [b10], [b44], [b23]) may also be related, but they do not seem to have the same level of direct influence on the novel contributions of PATHFID as [b14] and [b40]. Therefore, they are not included in the JSON output, in line with the instruction to limit the selection to the most central references.", "Based on the provided information and the instructions, we can infer the key source papers that heavily influenced the main contributions of the paper by following the steps outlined:\n\n1. Identify the novel contributions of the paper: The paper introduces PATHFID, a generative QA model that extends beyond answer generation by explicitly modeling the full reasoning path with a generative sequence-to-sequence model. It also introduces PATHFID+ for encoding cross-passage interactions.\n\n2. Prioritize methodological similarity: Look for references that share strong methodological similarities with PATHFID and PATHFID+.\n\n3. Look for comparative phrases: Search for phrases that indicate comparisons with previous work.\n\nBased on these criteria, we can see that the paper mentions the following references in the context of their novel contributions:\n\n- Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) is the baseline model that PATHFID extends upon. References [b14] and [b44] are associated with FID and are thus highly relevant.\n- The authors mention the challenge in multi-hop QA and their solution, which likely draws from the foundational work on this topic. Relevant references might include [b38], which discusses multi-hop reading comprehension, and [b42], the HotpotQA dataset specifically designed for multi-hop QA.\n- References [b31] and [b44] are mentioned in relation to pre-trained transformers like T5 and BART, which are foundational to the architecture of PATHFID.\n- Reference [b40] corroborates the observation that FID does not extend well to multi-hop QA, which is a problem that PATHFID aims to solve.\n- Reference [b9] is the IIRC dataset, which is used for evaluation alongside HotpotQA, indicating its relevance to the paper's contributions.\n\nNow let's list the most relevant references with a confidence score, assuming 1 indicates high relevance and confidence in the influence on the paper's novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b14\": 1,\n  \"b44\": 1,\n  \"b38\": 0.8,\n  \"b42\": 0.9,\n  \"b31\": 0.9,\n  \"b40\": 0.7,\n  \"b9\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the information provided and the context in which these references are mentioned in the paper. The scores reflect the assumed degree of influence or relevance to the paper's novel contributions.", "Based on the provided text, the PATHFID model is a generative QA model designed for multi-hop QA tasks which extends beyond answer generation by explicitly modeling the full reasoning path. It is an advancement over the Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) model, which is also mentioned as an inspiration for this work. The PATHFID model aims to address the challenges in multi-hop QA by providing a single sequence prediction task that models reasoning paths consisting of supporting passages and facts, and it introduces new mechanisms for encoding cross-passage interactions.\n\nFrom the description, it's clear that the FID model ([b14]) is a significant inspiration for PATHFID, as it's explicitly mentioned as the basis on which PATHFID improves. Additionally, the paper [b40] is cited as corroborating the observation that the success of FID does not extend to multi-hop QA, suggesting that [b40] also plays a role in setting the stage for the development of PATHFID. Moreover, references like [b31], which describes T5, a pre-trained transformer used in FID, are likely influential, as PATHFID builds upon the structure of such pre-trained models.\n\nGiven the focus on multi-hop QA, references that discuss this topic or datasets related to it, like [b42] (HotpotQA) and [b9] (IIRC), which are the datasets used for evaluating PATHFID, are also central to the paper's contributions. References that discuss evidence aggregation in multi-hop QA, such as [b3] and [b22], might also be important, considering the paper's emphasis on evidence fusion and reasoning paths.\n\nSince the task is to return less than 8 source papers and prioritize direct inspiration or motivation, I will focus on the most pertinent references based on the instructions and the text provided. The references are listed with a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high confidence that the reference is a direct source of inspiration or motivation for the paper's novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b14\": 1.0,  // Directly mentioned as the basis for FID, which PATHFID extends\n  \"b40\": 0.9,  // Corroborates the limitations of FID in multi-hop QA\n  \"b31\": 0.8,  // Describes T5, a pre-trained model used in FID and likely in PATHFID\n  \"b42\": 0.8,  // HotpotQA dataset used for evaluation\n  \"b9\": 0.8,   // IIRC dataset used for evaluation\n  \"b3\": 0.7,   // Related to evidence aggregation in multi-hop QA\n  \"b22\": 0.7   // Related to evidence aggregation in multi-hop QA\n}\n```\n\nNote that the confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the information provided and the prominence of each reference within the text. The paper may have other influences not directly stated in the text, and the confidence scores may be adjusted based on a deeper understanding of the full paper.", "Based on the provided text and the instructions, we need to determine which references were most influential to the contributions of the paper, specifically focusing on those that inspired the novel methodology or approach. The paper in question introduces PATHFID, which is built upon the Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) model but tailored to address the challenges of multi-hop question answering (QA).\n\nFrom the text, reference `[b14]` is mentioned in the context of introducing FID, which the authors of the paper are building upon for their PATHFID approach. This suggests that `[b14]` is a key source of inspiration. Additionally, the paper mentions limitations of FID found in `[b40]`, which also seems to have influenced the development of PATHFID.\n\nBased on the titles provided for each reference, we can infer that `[b42]` (\"HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering\") is highly relevant, as it is a dataset used for evaluating PATHFID and is central to multi-hop QA. Similarly, `[b9]` (\"IIRC: A Dataset of Incomplete Information Reading Comprehension Questions\") is another dataset used for evaluation, indicating its relevance.\n\nHere is the JSON output of the most relevant source papers with confidence scores indicating the degree of influence they have on the main contributions of the paper:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b14\": 1.0,\n  \"b40\": 0.9,\n  \"b42\": 0.95,\n  \"b9\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are based on the context in which the references are mentioned in the paper. `[b14]` is given the highest score due to its foundational role in the FID model, which PATHFID is built upon. `[b40]` is scored slightly lower, as it seems to be a critique that motivated improvements. `[b42]` and `[b9]` receive high scores due to their direct use in evaluating the new model, indicating their centrality to the research.\n\nNote that while other references are mentioned, they do not appear to be as directly influential to the novel contributions of the paper, such as the introduction of PATHFID, and therefore are not included in the list. If there were more specific text passages indicating direct inspiration from other references, they would also be included with appropriate confidence scores."], "62bbc3865aee126c0fa68605":

The Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner for extracting emotion-related displacements from emotion sources.\n3. The Emotion-Aware Motion Model (EAMM) for generating one-shot talking head animations with emotion control.\n\nTo identify the source papers, I will look for key phrases indicating direct inspiration or strong methodological similarity, and also evaluate the titles of the references for relevance.

The paper proposes an Emotion-Aware Motion Model (EAMM) that aims to generate talking face animations from a single image using audio input and an additional emotional video source for emotional dynamics.\n2. Key modules introduced in the paper include the Audio2Facial-Dynamics (A2FD) module and the Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner. The A2FD module is inspired by unsupervised zero-and first-order motion representations, and the Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner is designed to extract and encode emotion-related displacements from an emotional video source.\n\nConsidering the key phrases provided and the methodology described in the paper, we should look for references that are cited in relation to the A2FD module and the Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner. The reference that describes the unsupervised zero-and first-order motion representations is likely a significant source.\n\nThe author notes mention the use of \"one-shot\" methods and emotional dynamics, which are central to the paper's contributions. Therefore, we should prioritize references that are directly related to one-shot talking face generation and the handling of emotional expressions.\n\nBased on the text and titles of the references, the following list contains the most central references that likely influenced the main contributions of the paper:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b43\": 0.85,\n  \"b44\": 0.95,\n  \"b51\": 0.90,\n  \"b55\": 0.80,\n  \"b63\": 0.90,\n  \"b65\": 0.75\n}\n```\n\nHere's the rationale for each reference's confidence score:\n\n- **b43 and b55**: These references deal with animating objects and one-shot talking head synthesis, which is methodologically similar to the A2FD module. However, the paper seems to build upon these ideas rather than directly using them.\n\n- **b44**: This reference is mentioned in relation to the A2FD module and seems to be a backbone for the novel approach proposed in the paper, thus it has a high confidence score.\n\n- **b51**: The MEAD dataset is mentioned, and it seems to be relevant to the emotion-related aspects of the paper. The dataset is used for the emotional talking-face generation, which is a central part of the paper's contribution.\n\n- **b63**: This reference is related to talking face generation by adversarially disentangled audio-visual representation, which is similar to the A2FD module's approach and is likely to have provided significant inspiration for the paper.\n\n- **b65**: MakeItTalk is mentioned, which is related to speaker-aware talking head animation. While this is relevant to talking face generation, it may not be as central to the emotional dynamics aspect.\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the inferred influence of each reference on the paper's novel contributions. References with a confidence score closer to 1 are considered to have a stronger influence, while those closer to 0 are considered less influential.", "Based on the provided text and instructions, I will first identify the novel contributions of the paper to guide the search for source papers that directly influenced these contributions. The novel contributions of the paper are:\n\n1. The Audio2Facial-Dynamics (A2FD) module, which generates neutral audio-driven talking faces by predicting unsupervised motion representations in a simple manner.\n2. The Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner that can extract the face-related representations' displacements from emotion sources.\n3. The Emotion-Aware Motion Model (EAMM), which is capable of generating one-shot talking head animations with emotion control, claimed to be one of the earliest attempts in this field.\n\nNext, I will look for key phrases that indicate direct inspiration or motivation from other works, and highlight any references that are directly relevant to these novel contributions. The key phrases and related work sections provide an indication of which references are most relevant.\n\nFor the A2FD module, the paper mentions it was \"inspired by [b44] [b53]\" for unsupervised key points and their first-order dynamics. This suggests that references [b44] and [b53] played a significant role in the development of this module.\n\nFor the Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner, there isn't a direct \"inspired by\" phrase, but the paper discusses the challenge of decoupling emotional information, which is a novel aspect of their work. References that are methodologically similar or that provided a foundation for this work need to be identified.\n\nLastly, the Emotion-Aware Motion Model (EAMM) seems to be a novel contribution without a direct inspiration from a single paper. However, the paper mentions that video-driven animation leveraging a video to reenact facial motion is \"highly related to audio-driven talking-face generation,\" which implies that references [b43] and potentially others related to video-driven animation could be pertinent.\n\nGiven the information and constraints, here is the JSON format result of the most central references that heavily influenced the main contributions of the paper, along with a confidence score between 0 and 1:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b44\": 0.95,\n  \"b53\": 0.95,\n  \"b43\": 0.75\n}\n```\n\nI assigned a high confidence score to references [b44] and [b53] because they are explicitly mentioned as inspirations for the A2FD module. Reference [b43] is assigned a lower confidence score as it relates to the broader context of video-driven facial animation but is not directly cited as an inspiration for the EAMM.

The paper's novel contributions focus on generating expressive emotional editing under the one-shot talking face setting, emotion-aware motion modeling, and disentangling motion patterns for emotional expression.

The creation of an Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner that can extract face-related representations' displacements from emotion sources.\n\nThe text doesn\u2019t contain explicit phrases such as \"inspired by\" or \"motivated by,\" so we should look for methodological similarities and references tied to the main contributions.\n\nBased on these criteria, the following references are most relevant:\n\n- [b43] and [b55]: Both are related to the unsupervised zero-and first-order motion representations that are capable of modeling local flow fields on faces, which the paper's A2FD module uses for emotion deformations.\n- [b44]: This reference is specifically mentioned in the context of a pretrained key-point detector used within the A2FD module, indicating a direct methodological influence.\n- [b63]: This reference is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper and seems to be a major source of inspiration for both the concept of the A2FD module and the emotional talking face generation in a one-shot setting.\n- [b51]: MEAD dataset is used for training the implicit emotion displacement learner, which indicates its relevance to the paper's contributions about emotional control.\n\nThe confidence score for each reference reflects the likelihood that it directly influenced the paper's novel contributions.

We will prioritize papers with phrases indicating strong reliance or direct inspiration.\n\nThe novel contributions of this paper are:\n1. Analysis of the impact of high-latency remote memory on disaggregated memory systems.\n2. Observations that huge pages can cause inefficiency due to sparsity of access in disaggregated memory, on-demand swap is better than proactive swap, and a hybrid structure based on cache-line granularity access and page swap is more efficient.\n3. Implementation of the HotBox subsystem in the Linux kernel for intelligent management of remote memory based on page hotness sampling.\n\nNow let's identify the source papers with strong influence on these contributions:\n\n1. For the hybrid access mechanism combining cache-line accesses with page migration, the paper references [b6], [b14], [b27], [b47]. These papers discuss tiered memory systems and hybrid approaches and are likely influential based on the context.\n\n2. For the insights against huge pages and batch migration, and the preference for on-demand swap, the paper references [b47] as a state-of-the-art mechanism but then explains why it's not suited for higher-latency environments. The paper also references [b9], [b21], [b23], [b41] for swap-based systems, which are juxtaposed against the proposed HotBox mechanism.\n\n3. For the HotBox subsystem and its novel design choices, the paper references [b39] for dynamic page access sampling mechanisms. This indicates that the paper was influenced by the mechanisms studied in [b39].\n\n4. The paper references [b18] for the evaluation platform (Intel's Persistent Hybrid Memory Emulation Platform), which indicates that [b18] provided a basis for the evaluation but not necessarily the conceptual design of HotBox.\n\nLet's now compile the list of source papers in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b6\": 0.8,\n  \"b14\": 0.8,\n  \"b27\": 0.8,\n  \"b47\": 1.0,\n  \"b9\": 0.7,\n  \"b21\": 0.7,\n  \"b23\": 0.7,\n  \"b41\": 0.7,\n  \"b39\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the provided paper text and the context in which the references are used. A score of 1.0 for [b47] indicates that it is directly compared and discussed extensively, thus highly influential. Lower scores indicate that these works are also highly relevant but perhaps less directly influential on the novel contributions of this paper.", "Based on the provided text and author notes, we need to identify the source papers that most directly influenced the novel contributions of the given paper. Here are the steps to identify these papers:\n\n1. Extract the novel contributions from the author notes and paper text:\n    - Implementation of the HotBox subsystem in the Linux kernel.\n    - Intelligent management of remote memory based on page \"hotness\" sampling.\n    - Challenges addressed include inefficiency with large pages due to sparsity, superiority of on-demand swapping, and a better performance with a hybrid structure of cache-line granularity access and page swapping.\n\n2. Identify phrases indicating direct inspiration or reliance on previous research:\n    - The paper directly discusses the limitations of prior works [b9] [b21] [b23] [b41] for swap-only approaches.\n    - It contrasts the hybrid approach favored by [b6] [b14] [b27] [b47] with the proposed HotBox solution.\n    - It mentions the use of base pages instead of huge pages, countering the approach in [b6] [b47].\n    - The paper cites the inefficiency of batch migrations which were argued for in [b47], preferring on-demand migration.\n\n3. Rule out references that are mainly historical or not directly related to the novel contributions.\n\n4. Prioritize papers with methodological similarities, comparative phrases, or direct inspiration/motivation phrases.\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the most central references that heavily influenced the main contributions of the paper in JSON format with a confidence score:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"b6\": 0.8,\n    \"b9\": 0.9,\n    \"b21\": 0.9,\n    \"b23\": 0.9,\n    \"b41\": 0.9,\n    \"b47\": 1.0\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on how directly the paper's text indicates reliance on or contrast with the approaches in these references. The highest confidence is given to [b47] since it is mentioned multiple times as a point of reference for both methodological similarities and differences.

The paper states \"Inspired by the strength of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in aggregating contextual signals from neighboring nodes...\" which suggests that it builds upon previous GNN models. References [b15], [b29], [b4], and [b39] are mentioned in this context.\n\n2. The authors propose MHGCN to address challenges in current representation learning models, which \"largely relies on the accurate design of meta-paths.\" This suggests a departure from methods requiring manual meta-path design, which is a novel contribution. The references that discuss meta-path design are [b3], [b26], [b19], [b22], [b36], and [b38].\n\n3. The authors mention \"To improve the model efficiency, we endow our MHGCN with a simplified graph convolution...\" which indicates an improvement over existing methods. This could be related to [b33], which is about simplifying graph convolutional networks.\n\nBased on this analysis, the source papers that likely inspired the novel contributions of the given paper, with a confidence score between 0 and 1, would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b15\": 0.9,\n  \"b29\": 0.7,\n  \"b4\": 0.8,\n  \"b39\": 0.7,\n  \"b3\": 0.6,\n  \"b26\": 0.6,\n  \"b19\": 0.8,\n  \"b22\": 0.6,\n  \"b36\": 0.6,\n  \"b38\": 0.6,\n  \"b33\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective and based on the context in which the references are mentioned and the extent to which they seem to have influenced the novel contributions. The references with the phrases \"Inspired by\" and methods directly linked to the paper's contributions, such as [b15] and [b33], receive higher confidence scores.", "Based on the provided paper text and the author's notes, we need to identify source papers that directly influenced the novel contributions of the paper. The novel contributions are centered around addressing the challenges in the representation learning of attributed multiplex heterogeneous networks (AMHENs) with a new Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN).\n\nKey phrases indicating inspiration or direct methodological influence include:\n- \"Inspired by the strength of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in aggregating contextual signals from neighboring nodes...\"\n- \"To automatically capture meta-path information across multi-relations...\"\n- \"To improve the model efficiency, we endow our MHGCN with a simplified graph convolution...\"\n\nBased on these excerpts and the titles of the references, we can infer the following source papers:\n\n- `b3`: metapath2vec [Inspired the consideration of meta-paths]\n- `b4`: MAGNN [Inspired the meta-path aggregation technique]\n- `b15`: Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks [General inspiration from GNNs]\n- `b19`: Fast attributed multiplex heterogeneous network embedding [Inspired the aggregation of sub-networks with relation-aware node dependencies]\n- `b29`: Heterogeneous graph attention network [Inspired the challenge of heterogeneous graph learning]\n- `b33`: Simplifying graph convolutional networks [Inspired the simplified graph convolution for feature aggregation]\n\nThe confidence score for each paper is determined by how directly they are related to the novel contributions of the MHGCN framework:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b3\": 0.8,\n  \"b4\": 0.9,\n  \"b15\": 0.7,\n  \"b19\": 0.9,\n  \"b29\": 0.8,\n  \"b33\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\nHere, the confidence scores are high for `b4`, `b19`, and `b33` as they seem to be most directly related to the core methodological contributions of MHGCN. The scores for `b3` and `b29` are slightly lower as they are more about the general approach to handling heterogeneity in networks. `b15` has the lowest score as it's a general inspiration from the field of GNNs and not a specific methodological influence.", "Based on the criteria provided and the information from the paper excerpt, we will identify the source papers that are most pertinent to the novel contributions of the given paper. Given that the paper introduces a new Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN) for embedding on attributed multiplex heterogeneous networks (AMHENs), we will look for key phrases indicating direct inspiration or methodological similarity.\n\nFrom the provided text, the following references are directly related to the novel contributions of the paper:\n\n- The paper mentions that it is \"inspired by the strength of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\" and then lists various graph neural models designed to tackle the challenge of heterogeneous graph learning, such as HAN [b29], MAGNN [b4], and HetGNN [b39]. Among these, the closest related work would be MAGNN [b4] as it specifically addresses the issue of meta-path aggregation, which is a key aspect the MHGCN is trying to automate.\n\n- The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods for multiplex heterogeneous network embedding and then proposes a new method (MHGCN). References [b19], [b22], [b36], and [b42] are mentioned in the context of limitations and related work on multiplex heterogeneous network embedding.\n\n- The paper states that it builds upon the work of FAME [b19] by developing a spectral graph transformation component but aims to improve upon it by not relying on random projection.\n\n- The paper introduces a new multilayer graph convolution module to capture meta-path information across multi-relations, which suggests that work on graph convolutional networks, such as the simplified GCN approach mentioned in [b33], is also relevant.\n\n- The paper aims to improve model efficiency and mentions the simplified graph convolution approach to feature aggregation, which could indicate a methodological similarity with LightGCN [b8] that simplifies the design of graph convolutional networks.\n\nBased on the information given and the relevance to the novel contributions of the MHGCN model proposed in the paper, the most pertinent source papers are likely references [b4], [b19], [b33], and [b8]. The confidence scores are somewhat subjective without full access to the content of each reference paper.

The novel contributions in this case are the GraphMAE2 framework, which aims to improve feature reconstruction for graph SSL by imposing regularization on target reconstruction. Specifically, the paper introduces two decoding strategies: multi-view random re-mask decoding for reducing overfitting to the input features, and latent representation prediction for having more informative targets.\n\nLet's look for direct references to key phrases indicating strong reliance on previous research for developing the paper's core contributions.\n\n1. The paper builds upon the \"masked graph autoencoder GraphMAE\" for generative SSL on graphs, mentioned as GraphMAE [b17]. This is a direct precursor to GraphMAE2 and is likely to have heavily influenced the paper's main contributions.\n\n2. The concern for less discriminative reconstruction targets is backed by a study indicated by [b7], which shows the impact of the distinguishability of node features on GNN performance.\n\n3. The approach of \"multi-view random re-mask decoding\" is an improvement over the \"fixed re-mask decoding\" used in GraphMAE. This strategy might be inspired by semi-supervised learning techniques that involve randomness in propagation [b9].\n\n4. The idea of using a \"target generator network\" shares similarities with the teacher network in self-knowledge distillation [b4] or contrastive methods [b11]. However, the implementation and motivation in GraphMAE2 are different.\n\n5. To tackle scalability on large-scale graphs, the paper leverages \"local clustering\" algorithms, which is mentioned in reference to [b1] and [b35].\n\n6. The paper mentions the use of PPR-Nibble, a local clustering algorithm, referenced as [b1].\n\n7. The notion of \"encoder as denoising encoders\" and capturing \"high-level semantics\" references [b31].\n\nBased on the above analysis, here is the JSON-formatted list of source papers with confidence scores reflecting their judged influence on the main contributions of the paper:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b17\": 1.0,\n  \"b7\": 0.8,\n  \"b9\": 0.7,\n  \"b4\": 0.6,\n  \"b11\": 0.6,\n  \"b1\": 0.8,\n  \"b35\": 0.7,\n  \"b31\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the contextual clues provided in the paper text.

The references related to the challenges the paper is addressing (e.g., discriminability of features [b7], introducing randomness in propagation [b9], and encoder design [b31]) have high confidence scores as well, indicating a strong influence on the paper's novel contributions. References [b4] and [b11] receive moderate confidence scores as they relate to the broader concept of self-supervised learning and target generation that influenced the novel approach presented in GraphMAE2.

The paper focuses on the challenge of personalized subgraph selection in the context of GNN-based link prediction (GNNLP), where the connectivity patterns of nodes in real-world graphs are complex and diverse. This requires personalization of the subgraph selection process, which is a nontrivial task due to the exponential selection space and the necessity for inductive selection.\n\n2. The novel method introduced is the personalized subgraph selector (PS2), which is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem and solved using an alternating gradient-descent algorithm. The PS2 method is inspired by differentiable architecture search, but it extends the concept to select subgraphs in an inductive manner. This differs from the traditional architecture search which is transductive in nature.\n\n3.

The novel contributions are the TaxoPrompt framework for taxonomy expansion using prompt-based methods and a random walk algorithm to capture global structure knowledge and infuse it into the language model.\n\nFirst, let's identify direct references to inspiration and methodology:\n\n1. The paper proposes a self-supervised framework called TaxoPrompt, which is directly inspired by the recent successes of prompt-based methods.

The paper emphasizes the necessity of pre-fine-tuning transformers with graph information and discusses the warm-starting of GNN weights, which suggests that references discussing pre-training transformers and GNNs would be influential.\n\n3. The paper mentions the use of RGCN [b20], indicating a methodological similarity and direct relevance to the LM-GNN framework.\n\n4. The paper also discusses the problem of node classification and link prediction, which suggests that references dealing with these specific tasks would be relevant.\n\n5. The paper highlights the importance of using pre-trained language models like BERT [b8] and adapting them for graph ML applications.\n\n6. References to distributed training of GNNs [b29] are also relevant given the paper's focus on scalability and efficiency.\n\nBased on these points, I will now infer the most central references and provide them with a confidence score:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b8\": 0.9,  // BERT is central to the proposed LM-GNN framework as a semantic encoder.\n  \"b20\": 0.9, // RGCN is used as the graph encoder in the LM-GNN framework, indicating a strong influence.\n  \"b12\": 0.7, // Discusses representation learning on graphs, which is central to the GNN aspect of the LM-GNN framework.\n  \"b7\": 0.7, // Discusses pre-training BERT models on graph data, which is a component of the LM-GNN framework.\n  \"b29\": 0.7  // Relevant for distributed GNN training, which is a part of the scalability solution in LM-GNN.\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence score reflects the relevance and the direct influence each reference has on the novel contributions of the LM-GNN framework. References with a confidence score of 0.9 are considered highly influential, while those with a score of 0.7 are also relevant but to a lesser extent.

A stage-wise fine-tuning framework termed LM-GNN for encoding text data with transformers and GNN models.\n2. System and design optimizations to achieve scalable and efficient training.\n\nLooking for comparative phrases and methodological similarities, let's identify the references that are related to these contributions:\n\n- The concept of using a transformer model (BERT) with graph neural networks seems central to the paper's contributions. Reference [b8], which is about \"pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding,\" can be considered highly relevant as it is about the BERT model, which is a key component of the LM-GNN framework.\n\n- The stage-wise fine-tuning approach and the integration with graph neural networks are also novel. References that discuss fine-tuning BERT models and GNNs, such as [b7] (\"node feature extraction by self supervised multi scale neighborhood prediction\"), [b20] (\"modeling relational data with graph convolutional networks\"), and [b26] (\"a comprehensive survey on graph neural networks\") could be sources of inspiration.\n\n- References that address the challenge of efficiency and scalability, such as [b11] (\"inductive representation learning on large graphs\") and [b29] (\"distributed hybrid CPU and GPU training for graph neural networks on billion-scale graphs\"), are directly relevant to the system and design optimizations mentioned in the paper.\n\nBased on the instructions and the analysis of the paper's text, here is a list of source papers with confidence scores in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b8\": 1,\n  \"b7\": 0.8,\n  \"b20\": 0.8,\n  \"b26\": 0.8,\n  \"b11\": 0.7,\n  \"b29\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the criteria that the references should be directly related to the novel contributions of the paper. The score of 1 for reference [b8] indicates it is highly relevant, as it directly pertains to the BERT model used in the LM-GNN framework. The scores of 0.8 for [b7], [b20], and [b26] suggest strong relevance, particularly in the context of integrating BERT with GNN and discussing GNN methodologies. The scores of 0.7 for [b11] and [b29] reflect their relevance to the challenges of efficiency and scalability in training GNNs.", "Based on the information provided and the instructions, I will analyze the text to identify the source papers that have most directly inspired the novel contributions of the given paper.

I will now look for phrases in the text indicating strong reliance on previous research and identify the source papers.\n\nFrom the text provided, the following references are directly related to the novel contributions of the paper:\n\n- The LM-GNN framework is a novel approach for joint training of language models with GNNs. The paper mentions that \"Recent work [b7] also identifies that pre-training BERT models in graph data can be beneficial\" but does not explore joint fine-tuning with GNN models. Therefore, [b7] can be considered a source of inspiration but not as strong as those that directly contributed to the LM-GNN framework.\n\n- The stage-wise fine-tuning approach is a novel contribution, and the paper does not indicate a specific prior work that inspired this approach. It is an internal contribution of the paper.\n\n- For graph-aware pre-fine-tuning, the paper mentions that this process makes the language model more suitable for end-to-end training with the GNN, which is supported by the experiments in Section 5. However, no specific reference is linked to this contribution as an inspiration source.\n\n- The paper introduces several optimizations to address efficiency in training at scale. The use of caching BERT embeddings, joint negative sampling, and distributed GNN training (which extends [b29]) are mentioned as efficiency optimizations. Thus, [b29] could be considered an inspiration source for distributed training aspects.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON format output with reference numbers and confidence scores would be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b7\": 0.7,\n  \"b29\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimations based on the given instructions and the presence of specific phrases in the paper that link these references to the novel contributions. The score for [b7] is lower because it is acknowledged as beneficial prior work but not as a direct inspiration for the joint fine-tuning approach. The score for [b29] is higher due to the explicit mention of extending its approach for distributed GNN training.

Since RGCNs are specifically mentioned as being extended to the heterogeneous graph setting, this suggests that [b20] is a methodological predecessor to the work presented.\n\nReference [b8] is mentioned in the context of using BERT as the transformer in the LM-GNN framework.

methodological similarity, and comparative phrases as mentioned in the instructions.\n\nFrom the text, the following points are noted:\n1. The paper introduces the concept of \"sparse upcycling,\" which is a method of upgrading an existing model with a relatively small additional computational budget.\n2. The authors focus on upcycling dense models into sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs).\n3. The challenge mentioned is overcoming the initial performance decrease when changing a trained network's structure.\n4. They use pretrained dense Transformer checkpoints for initialization.\n5. They mention specific architectures such as T5 and Vision Transformers (ViT) and specific methods like Expert Choice routing.\n\nNow, let's identify the key references based on these points:\n\nReference `b15` talks about \"Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\". Given the mention of efficient sparsity and scaling, which is central to sparse upcycling, this is likely a key source.\n\nReference `b25` discusses \"GShard: Scaling Giant Models with Conditional Computation and Automatic Sharding\", which could be relevant due to the focus on scaling models and the mention of conditional computation, which is related to sparsity.\n\nReference `b55` is titled \"Mixture of Experts with Expert Choice Routing\", which is directly mentioned in the text as the routing algorithm used.\n\nReference `b36` is \"Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer\" (T5). This is relevant as T5 is mentioned as one of the architectures they are upcycling.\n\nReference `b12` is \"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\" (ViT). This is pertinent because Vision Transformers are mentioned as part of the architecture for the vision tasks.\n\nReference `b37` is about \"Scaling Vision with Sparse Mixture of Experts\", which seems directly related to the paper's topic, considering it combines vision tasks with MoEs.\n\nHere is the JSON format output with the confidence scores based on the relevance to the novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b15\": 0.95,\n  \"b25\": 0.9,\n  \"b55\": 0.95,\n  \"b36\": 0.8,\n  \"b12\": 0.8,\n  \"b37\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the provided text and how closely the titles and context of the references align with the novel contributions of the paper.", "Based on the provided text and information, we need to identify the source papers that directly influenced the novel contributions of the paper focused on \"sparse upcycling\" of deep neural networks.

The higher the score, the more influential the source paper to the development of BioGPT. \n\nThe paper's primary inspiration seems to be from papers b1 (\"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\"), b5 (\"Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners\"), and b8 (\"Domain-specific language model pretraining for biomedical natural language processing\"), which discuss pre-training models for language understanding tasks and the need for domain-specific pre-training in the biomedical field. \n\nThe other papers like b9, b10, and b20 also appear to have contributed significantly to the development of the BioGPT's methodology. Finally, the papers b47 and b48 might have inspired the fine-tuning method for downstream tasks. \n\nThis analysis is based on the presence of key phrases and the relevance of the references to the challenges and novel methods proposed in the paper.

Fine-tuning the pre-trained model iHT on smaller KGs, achieving better results than traditional models and pre-trained language models.\n\nThe text of the paper mentions several references in the context of inspiration and methodology:\n\n- The success of transfer learning in NLP, which inspired the use of large-scale pre-trained language models (LMs) to improve KG completion models, is mentioned alongside references [b37] and [b6].\n- The paper introduces a Transformer-based relational scoring module, which is said to be more expressive and versatile than conventional approaches, citing reference [b4].\n- The initialization from pre-trained LMs is inspired by the architecture's scalability and transferability shown in pre-trained language models, referring to [b9].\n\nConsidering the author's notes and the key phrases in the text, the following references are the most central to the paper's novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b4\": 0.9,\n  \"b37\": 0.75,\n  \"b6\": 0.75,\n  \"b9\": 0.9,\n  \"b32\": 0.75\n}\n```\n\nConfidence scores are subjective estimates based on the degree of relevance and the emphasis given in the text. For instance, references [b4] and [b9] are directly linked to the core methodology of employing a Transformer-based architecture and leveraging pre-trained LMs, so they receive a higher confidence score. Reference [b32] is included due to its relevance to the pre-training discussion, and references [b37] and [b6] are linked to the inspiration drawn from the success of transfer learning in NLP.

The paper mentions the practical implementation of a 128-bit microarchitecture and refers to `b2` - \"volume i user level isa document version\", which might be the RISC-V ISA documentation that includes a 128-bit extension. Since the authors use RISC-V's 128-bit extension material for experimentation, this reference is directly relevant. Confidence score: High\n\n5. The paper also discusses the impact of 128-bit address space on various microarchitectural components, which might be influenced by `b4` - \"the amd zen processor\" and `b5` - \"intel alder lake cpu architectures\" if these works include discussions on such impacts.

Highlighted references that are linked to the primary challenges and methodologies proposed.\n\nBased on these criteria, here is the JSON format list of source papers with confidence scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b4\": 0.9,\n  \"b5\": 0.8,\n  \"b8\": 0.9,\n  \"b10\": 0.7,\n  \"b15\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **b4 (\"sequence clock a dynamic resource orchestrator for serverless architectures\")**: This is mentioned as a CPU-quota scaling controller that DVFaaS outperforms. It is directly related to the methodology proposed, hence the high confidence score.\n  \n- **b5 (\"aquatope qos and uncertainty aware resource management for multi stage serverless workflows\")**: This work is related to the QoS-aware serverless engines, which is a central theme in the paper, thus the high confidence score.\n\n- **b8 (\"gemini learning to manage cpu power for latency critical search engines\")**: Directly compared with DVFaaS and mentioned as a state-of-the-art DVFS governor that the proposed method aims to improve upon. The paper also demonstrates a 20% power improvement over Gemini, making it highly relevant.\n\n- **b10 (\"tackling performance variability due to ras mechanisms with pid controlled dvfs\")**: Although not highlighted as a main inspiration, it is related to using PID-controlled DVFS, which is a central theme in the paper.\n\n- **b15 (\"sebs a serverless benchmark suite for function as a service computing\")**: This is used to provide workload scenarios for evaluations, and while it's not a direct methodological inspiration, it is relevant to the testing of the proposed solution.\n\nThe confidence scores reflect how directly related the works are to the novel contributions of the paper. The papers with the highest confidence scores (b4, b5, and b8) are those where the proposed solution is directly building upon or improving existing solutions. The lower confidence score for b15 reflects its supportive role in providing benchmarks rather than direct methodological inspiration.", "Given the author notes and the text provided, we can infer the most pertinent source papers that the given paper is inspired by. Let's extract the references that seem to be central to the paper's novel contributions:\n\n1. References that describe similar methodological approaches, such as the use of DVFS in a serverless context.\n2. References that are contrasted against in the evaluation, indicating that the paper's method improves upon or differs from these approaches.\n3. References that are directly mentioned in the context of novel contributions or that are directly relevant to the paper's method.\n\nFrom the text, we can infer that references [b4], [b5], and [b8] are particularly pertinent, as the paper makes direct comparisons with these works in the context of their contributions and evaluates their proposed solution against these existing approaches.\n\nReference [b4] (\"Sequence clock: a dynamic resource orchestrator for serverless architectures\") and [b5] (\"Aquatope: QoS and uncertainty aware resource management for multi-stage serverless workflows\") are mentioned as related work that utilizes CPU quotas, which the authors of our paper seem to be improving upon with their approach.\n\nReference [b8] (\"Gemini: learning to manage CPU power for latency-critical search engines\") is mentioned as a state-of-the-art DVFS governor that the proposed solution (DVFaaS) outperforms, indicating that the authors' approach was influenced by and directly compares to this work.\n\nThe proposed solution DVFaaS seems to be novel in its application of a PID controller to regulate end-to-end execution time of serverless chains across nodes, considering the propagated latency (slack) at each step. This indicates that the method is distinct from the approaches taken in references [b4], [b5], and [b8], but it is inspired by their shortcomings or limitations.\n\nBased on the information given, here is a JSON-formatted list of the source papers with confidence scores reflecting their direct relevance to the paper's novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b4\": 0.9,\n  \"b5\": 0.9,\n  \"b8\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are high for these references as they are explicitly mentioned in the context of the novel contributions and are used as a basis for comparison in the evaluation section, indicating a strong reliance on these works for the development of the paper's core contributions.", "Based on the given text and the author's note, we are looking for source papers that directly influenced the main contributions of the paper, which are related to employing a PID method for DVFS control in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) context to minimize system power consumption while ensuring function QoS.\n\nTo find the most pertinent source papers, we will look for key phrases that indicate a strong reliance on previous research, especially those that are linked to the challenges and methods introduced in the paper, such as the use of DVFS and PID control for serverless functions.\n\nAfter reviewing the text and given information, we can infer the following relevant source papers:\n\n- [b4]: \"SeqClock [b4], a CPU-quota scaling controller\" is mentioned as a point of comparison for the power improvement achieved by the proposed DVFaaS solution. This suggests that [b4] influenced the approach, although the proposed method outperforms it.\n  \n- [b8]: \"Gemini [b8], a state-of-the-art DVFS governor\" is directly compared to the proposed DVFaaS solution, and it is mentioned that DVFaaS presents a power improvement over Gemini. This comparison and mention as a state-of-the-art solution make [b8] a likely source of inspiration.\n\n- [b10]: Although not directly mentioned in the context of inspiration, [b10] is cited in relation to prior works implementing DVFS, which is central to the paper's contribution.\n\n- [b7]: Mentioned in the context of system-level techniques for power management, which is relevant to the paper's focus on DVFS as a power management technique.\n\nGiven the context and the specific mention of these papers in relation to the novel contributions of the paper, the confidence scores for each are inferred as follows, with 1 indicating the highest level of confidence that the paper was a source of direct inspiration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b4\": 0.8,\n  \"b8\": 0.9,\n  \"b10\": 0.7,\n  \"b7\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\nNote that these scores are subjective and based on the context in which the papers are mentioned. The scores reflect the degree to which the text suggests that these papers were critical to the development of the paper's own contributions. The confidence is higher for [b8] because it is directly referred to as a state-of-the-art solution, and DVFaaS is described as an improvement over it. The confidence is slightly lower for [b4] since it is used more as a point of comparison rather than a direct inspiration.

Look for methodological similarities:\n   - The use of LLMs for generating pseudo-documents is similar to other methods that utilize LLMs for various IR tasks.\n   - The concatenation of pseudo-documents with queries for expansion is a novel approach that builds upon the concept of document and query expansion.\n\n3. Search for comparative phrases and key phrases indicating direct inspiration:\n   - The paper does not contain explicit phrases such as \"inspired by\" or \"motivated by,\" but methodological similarities and improvements upon previous methods can be deduced.\n\nBased on the information provided, here are the source papers that seem to have the most direct relevance and likely influence on the paper's novel contributions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b2\": 1.0,  // \"Language models are few-shot learners\" - Direct use of LLMs for query expansion\n  \"b3\": 0.8,  // \"MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset\" - In-domain evaluation dataset\n  \"b11\": 0.9, // \"Dense passage retrieval for open-domain question answering\" - Dense retrieval methodology\n  \"b12\": 0.7, // \"Relevance-based language models\" - Related to query expansion methods\n  \"b18\": 0.8, // No title provided, but likely relevant due to the context of document expansion\n  \"b23\": 0.7, // \"BEIR: A heterogeneous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation of information retrieval models\" - Zero-shot out-of-domain evaluation\n  \"b27\": 0.9  // \"SimLM: Pre-training with representation bottleneck for dense passage retrieval\" - Dense retrieval methodology\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores reflect the direct relevance and influence of each paper, with 1.0 being the highest.

The primary novel contribution of the paper seems to be the \"query2doc\" method, which uses few-shot prompting of large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-documents for query expansion in information retrieval systems.\n\nFrom the text, we can identify several key references that seem to be directly relevant to the paper's contributions:\n\n- The use of large language models (LLMs) for query expansion seems to be inspired by the capabilities of LLMs as described in reference [b2].\n- The comparison with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) methods points towards references [b12] and [b15] which discuss PRF and its limitations.\n- The paper also contrasts the \"query2doc\" method with document expansion methods like doc2query, which is related to reference [b18].\n- The improvement over sparse retrieval systems like BM25, without model fine-tuning, puts an emphasis on references [b3] and [b13], which discuss BM25 and its implementation in Pyserini.\n- The paper mentions dense retrievers such as DPR [b11], SimLM [b27], and E5 [b27], indicating that these works might have influenced their approach to dense retrieval.\n- A comparison with the HyDE approach [b9] is made, discussing differences in methodology.\n\nBased on the task instructions, we should prioritize source papers based on their methodological similarity and how they are directly related to the novel contributions of the paper, while also looking for phrases that indicate direct inspiration.\n\nHere is the JSON result with the reference number as the key and the confidence score between 0 and 1 as the value:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b2\": 0.9,\n  \"b12\": 0.7,\n  \"b15\": 0.7,\n  \"b18\": 0.8,\n  \"b3\": 0.6,\n  \"b13\": 0.6,\n  \"b11\": 0.8,\n  \"b27\": 0.8,\n  \"b9\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective and based on the emphasis placed on each reference within the text.

The methods for sparse and dense retrieval ([b3], [b11], [b13], [b27]) are also directly relevant but have a slightly lower confidence score since they are part of the comparison rather than the inspiration.

This work is related to the zero-shot setting, which is part of the paper's evaluation, but the influence seems less direct than others.\n\nThese references have been prioritized because they are directly linked to the paper's novel contributions and are preceded by phrases indicating direct inspiration or motivation for the methods used in the paper. The scores reflect the degree of relevance and influence on the paper's core contributions.", "Based on the information provided and the criteria for identifying source papers, I will analyze the given text for key phrases that indicate inspiration or strong reliance on previous work, and then match these with the provided references to determine the most pertinent source papers to the paper's novel contributions.\n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n1. The paper introduces \"query2doc\" as a new method of query expansion by generating pseudo-documents through few-shot prompting LLMs, particularly using GPT-3's \"davinci-003\" model.\n2. The paper compares this method with traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) techniques and document expansion methods.\n3. The paper also discusses the importance of LLM scale in improving the quality of query expansion, mentioning smaller language models versus larger ones like the 175B model.\n\nFrom the text, we see that:\n- The method is described as \"inspired by\" or \"building upon\" LLMs' ability to memorize knowledge and language patterns (reference [b2]).\n- The paper compares its method to traditional query expansion (references [b12], [b15], [b21]) and document expansion (references [b18]).\n- The paper investigates the training of dense retrievers and mentions hard negative mining (reference [b29]), intermediate pretraining (reference [b8]), and knowledge distillation (reference [b19]).\n\nGiven the emphasis on LLMs and the few-shot prompting technique for generating pseudo-documents, the most central references are likely those directly related to large language models and the specific methods for dense retrieval optimization. The references to the pseudo-relevance feedback and document expansion methods serve as a comparison to the proposed method but are not the primary inspiration.\n\nTherefore, the json format for the most pertinent source papers with confidence scores is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b2\": 1.0,\n  \"b29\": 0.8,\n  \"b8\": 0.8,\n  \"b19\": 0.8,\n  \"b18\": 0.7,\n  \"b12\": 0.6,\n  \"b15\": 0.6,\n  \"b21\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\n- Reference [b2] (\"language models are few-shot learners\") is the key source paper as it directly relates to the use of LLMs (GPT-3) for query expansion.\n- References [b29], [b8], [b19] are related to the methodological aspects of dense retrieval.\n- Reference [b18] is related to document expansion, which is compared to the proposed method; thus, it has a slightly lower confidence score.\n- References [b12], [b15], [b21] are related to traditional PRF methods, which are compared rather than being the inspiration for the method.\n\nThis selection is limited to eight references, with the confidence scores reflecting the degree of direct relevance to the novel contributions of the paper.", "Based on the detailed instructions provided and the text of the paper, I will identify the most pertinent source papers that inspired the authors' work.

The novel contributions include the method \"query2doc\" to improve information retrieval systems by using large language models (LLMs) for query expansion through pseudo-document generation.\n\nHere are the steps to identify the source papers:\n\n1. Determine the novel contributions: The paper introduces \"query2doc,\" a method for query expansion using few-shot prompted LLMs to generate pseudo-documents that are then concatenated with the original query.\n\n2. Look for key phrases indicating direct inspiration or strong methodological similarities.\n\n3. Identify references linked to the main method and its challenges.\n\nBased on the information provided and the titles of the references, the following references seem to be the most pertinent source papers:\n\n- `b2`: \"Language models are few-shot learners\" \u2013 The paper uses LLMs for few-shot prompting, which is a direct application of the concept that language models can learn from a few examples.\n- `b12`: \"Relevance-based language models\" \u2013 This is related to query expansion techniques that the paper is building upon.\n- `b18`: Not provided but likely related to document expansion methods like \"doc2query,\" which is mentioned as an effective method for sparse retrieval that the paper seems to build upon.\n- `b11`: \"Dense passage retrieval for open-domain question answering\" \u2013 The paper compares its method with dense retrievers and mentions DPR, which is likely described in this reference.\n- `b27`: \"A SimLM: Pre-training with representation bottleneck for dense passage retrieval\" and \"E5\" \u2013 These references are mentioned in the context of strong dense retrievers that benefit from the proposed query expansion method.\n- `b3`: \"MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset\" \u2013 Used for in-domain evaluation, indicating methodological relevance.\n\nGiven the information, the JSON format with reference numbers and confidence scores might look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"b2\": 0.9,\n  \"b12\": 0.8,\n  \"b18\": 0.85,\n  \"b11\": 0.75,\n  \"b27\": 0.7,\n  \"b3\": 0.65\n}\n```\n\nThe confidence scores are subjective estimates based on the direct relevance of the references to the paper's novel contributions and methods. The paper's reliance on the concept of few-shot learners (b2) and query expansion (b12) seems to be at its core.

It also compares its approach with pseudo-relevance feedback methods [b12] [b15] and mentions the effectiveness of document expansion methods like doc2query [b18].
